## 🔐 About Me

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional and Python developer with a strong focus on ethical hacking and red team operations. Passionate about offensive security techniques, vulnerability research, and building secure applications. My repositories document my learning journey as I explore the offensive side of security while maintaining ethical boundaries and responsible practices.

## 🛠️ Current Skills

- **Python**: Core concepts, OOP, automation scripts, exploit development
- **Ethical Hacking**: Reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation techniques
- **Red Team Operations**: Attack vectors, persistence mechanisms, lateral movement
- **Penetration Testing**: Methodology, reporting, remediation recommendations
- **Linux**: Command line operations, bash scripting, security tool customization
- **Web Security**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, attack methodologies

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

- Advanced exploitation techniques and custom payload development
- Social engineering and physical security assessment
- Active Directory attack vectors and privilege escalation
- Network protocol analysis and exploitation
- Malware analysis and reverse engineering
- Evasion techniques and red team tradecraft
